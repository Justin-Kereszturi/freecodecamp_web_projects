  <div class="ul-div">
      <ul class="ul-one">
        <li><strong>Alternating current</strong> | 1893 - at the Worldâ€™s Expo in Chicago where the feud between Edison's direct current and Tesla's alternating current culminated. The direct current, which was invented by Thomas Edison, was very dangerous and costly over long distances. Tesla sought to implement alternating current for the power grid because it was cheaper and safer. To prove the safety of AC, he reportedly used a Tesla coil to send electricity through himself to produce light. Despite Edison's and General Electric's efforts to implement direct current, Tesla won the battle of the currents. </li><br />
      </ul>

    <li><strong>First hydro-electric power plant - </strong>
Nikola Tesla along with George Westinghouse constructed the world's first hydro-electric power plant at the base of Niagra Falls. The power plant remains to this day as a museum, but it was one of the first energy generation locations that started the process of electrifying the world.</li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Tesla's induction motor - </strong>
Proclaimed as one of the 10 greatest inventions of all time, Tesla's induction motor revolutionized was what possible in the appliance industry. It was the first instance where electrical energy could be sustainably converted to mechanical energy. This gave way to compact mixing machines to washing machines among many other things. Essentially all modern electronics that utilize electric motors can thank Tesla for their existence.</li><br />
    <li>
      <strong>Measurement of flux density - </strong>
One of the lesser knowns of Tesla's achievements is the foundation of a reliable unit in the measurement of magnetic flux density. Tesla discovered rotating magnetic fields in 1882, which served as a core discovery around alternating current. Rotating magnetic fields are used in a wide array of fields, with an MRI machine the forefront of the technology. Tesla was honored with the international unit of flux density used to describe the strength of magnetic fields in 1956.
      </li><br />
    <li>
      <strong>Wireless transmission - </strong>
One of Tesla's greatest inventions and predictions of the future was that of wireless data and energy transmission. J.P. Morgan company invested $150,000 into Tesla's idea of wireless transmission with the goal of finding frequencies which data could transmit across. The tower that Tesla built was the world's first wireless transmission system, and his ideas in this field laid the groundwork for the possibility of modern wireless data.

Tesla's genius will go down in history. He was the author of numerous books, developed and designed many devices, but still died in poverty, in January 1943, at the age of 86.

  <h3>Five of Nicola Tesla's Quotes</h3>
    <div class="quote-div">
      <ul>
        <li>The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine.</li><br />
        <li>Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter. When they separate, man is no more.
</li><br />
        <li>The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane.</li><br />
        <li>I do not think you can name many great inventions that have been made by married men.
</li><br />
        <li>The spread of civilisation may be likened to a fire; first, a feeble spark, next a flickering flame, then a mighty blaze, ever increasing in speed and power.</li><br />
